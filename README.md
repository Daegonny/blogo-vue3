## About

Blogo is a toy project. It helped me to learn and apply graphql tools and concepts.
The project models three related entities: Authors, Posts and Tags of a blog website.

The frontend was written using the VueJS 3 framework and the Apollo Graphql client.
More info about the graphql backend API can be found at: [blogo-graphql](https://github.com/Daegonny/blogo-graphql)
