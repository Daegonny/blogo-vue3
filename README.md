## About

Blogo is a toy project. It helped me to learn and apply graphql tools and concepts.
The project models three related entities: Authors, Posts and Tags of a blog website.

The frontend was written using the VueJS 3 framework and the Apollo Graphql client.
More info about the graphql backend API can be found at: [blogo-graphql](https://github.com/Daegonny/blogo-graphql)

## Online Hosting

The app is hosted on render at [https://read-blogo.onrender.com/](https://read-blogo.onrender.com/)
And due to [render free hosting constraints](https://render.com/docs/free#free-web-services) the loading time can take a little long more than expected.
